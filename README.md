# Measuring-Similarity-Between-Texts
A Python script to measure similarity between texts!

The program takes a predefined .csv file namely 'Requirements Dataset.csv' as input and accepts a search text from the user as another input.

On converting the accepted search string into a csv file, pandas dataframes are used to read csv files and to generate corresponding dataframes.
